# Cheatsheet for Common CSS Properties
## Introduction

A Codecademy project to make a cheatsheet to have quick access to information about either HTML or CSS (in my case, CSS). More or less a slighly elaborated version of [this page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Properties_Reference).

## Languages Used

- HTML
- CSS

## How to Open

Download both files into one folder (making sure that there are no other *index.html* or *styles.css* documents in the folder) and open *index.html*.

## Sections

The HTML file is split into the following sections (linked at the top of the webpage):

1. Background
2. Borders
3. Text & Fonts
4. Positioning & Spacing
5. Other Properties

I'm aware that *other properties* isn't particularly helpful but I couldn't think of a good catch-all for the few remaining items.

**Have fun and I hope it's helpful!**
